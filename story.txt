Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree,
which was on the banks of the river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next for some more fruits as he loved them.
As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
One day monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife.
She ate the fruits and liked them but was jealous with the monkey.
She told her husband,"If the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkeys hearts would be.
Get me the heart of the monkey"
The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend but had no choice.
